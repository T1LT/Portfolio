Hi, I'm Nishant, a super passionate Software Engineer based in Cupertino, specializing in the Frontend! I have a degree in Computer Science and completed a competitive bootcamp, providing me with strong fundamentals and hands-on experience with the latest technologies and coding conventions being used in the industry. I'm a firm believer of the fact that learning is a continuous process and love that I get to do so on a daily basis as an engineer. I also dabble in portrait and product photography in my free time.
